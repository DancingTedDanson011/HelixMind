# Introducing HelixMind

Every AI coding tool today has the same fundamental problem: **they forget everything**.

Every session starts from zero. You re-explain your architecture. You re-describe your patterns. You lose context and waste hours debugging things your AI already fixed yesterday.

## The Problem

We've used every tool on the market — Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Aider, Cline. They're all powerful. They're all fast. And they all suffer from the same amnesia.

The context window is not memory. It's a conversation that gets thrown away.

## The Solution: Spiral Memory

HelixMind introduces a fundamentally different approach: **Spiral Context Memory**.

Instead of flat conversations that disappear, HelixMind organizes your project's knowledge into 5 hierarchical levels that evolve over time:

- **L1 Focus** — What you're working on right now
- **L2 Active** — Recent patterns and decisions
- **L3 Reference** — Stable architecture knowledge
- **L4 Archive** — Historical context
- **L5 Deep Archive** — Compressed summaries

Context promotes when accessed, decays when stale, and compresses at the deepest level. Your AI literally grows smarter about your project over time.

## Open Source

HelixMind is fully open source under AGPL-3.0. Install it today:

```bash
npm install -g helixmind
```

Run fully offline with Ollama. Your data never leaves your machine.

## What's Next

We're building cloud sync, team brains, and a web dashboard. Stay tuned.
