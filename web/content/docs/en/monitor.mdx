# Monitor

The **Monitor** tab provides continuous security surveillance for your project. It watches for threats, suspicious changes, and potential vulnerabilities in real-time.

## Three monitoring modes

### Passive Mode

Observes file changes and git activity without taking action. Ideal for awareness:

- Watches for suspicious file modifications
- Tracks dependency changes
- Logs potential security events
- No automatic responses

### Defensive Mode

Actively detects and reports threats with suggested responses:

- Scans new/modified files for vulnerabilities
- Alerts on dependency changes with known CVEs
- Suggests fixes for detected issues
- Reports findings to the Brain visualization

### Active Mode

Full autonomous protection — detects and auto-responds to threats:

- Automatically reverts suspicious changes
- Blocks dangerous commands
- Applies security patches
- Creates detailed incident reports

## Threat detection

The monitor identifies common security issues:

- **Secrets exposure** — API keys, tokens, passwords in code
- **Dependency risks** — Known vulnerabilities in packages
- **Code injection** — SQL injection, XSS, command injection patterns
- **Permission escalation** — Unauthorized access pattern changes
- **Supply chain** — Suspicious dependency additions

## Viewing threats

Active threats appear with severity indicators:

- **Critical** — Immediate action required
- **High** — Should be addressed soon
- **Medium** — Review when convenient
- **Low** — Informational

## Defense actions

When the monitor takes defensive action, each entry shows:

- What action was taken
- The target file or resource
- The reason for the action
- Whether it was auto-approved
- Whether the action is reversible

## Starting the monitor

Use the Monitor tab controls or the CLI:

```bash
/security monitor passive
/security monitor defensive
/security monitor active
```
