# Best Practices

## Getting Started Right

1. **Initialize every project** — `helixmind init` for project-local memory
2. **Write good context** — `.helixmind/context.md` with tech stack, architecture, conventions
3. **Feed key files early** — `helixmind feed README.md --deep src/core/`

## Daily Workflow

| When | What |
|------|------|
| **Start of day** | `helixmind` — the AI knows your project from yesterday |
| **During development** | Let AI explain code, write tests first, check `/spiral` |
| **End of day** | Run `/security` in the background |

## Spiral Memory Tips

- **Let it learn naturally** — Don't front-load everything at once
- **Use semantic search** — `helixmind spiral search "how we handle auth"`
- **Check periodically** — `/spiral` shows what the AI knows

## Agent Interaction

- **Be specific** — Instead of "Fix the bug" say "Fix the auth middleware — JWT tokens expire too early"
- **Let it explore first** — "Read the auth module and explain the token refresh"
- **Skip-permissions for flow** — `/skip-permissions` when actively watching
- **Review before committing** — `/diff`, Validation Matrix, run tests

## Choosing the Right Model

| Task | Recommended |
|------|------------|
| Quick fixes | Haiku / GPT-4o-mini |
| General coding | Sonnet / GPT-4o |
| Complex architecture | Opus |
| Offline / privacy | Ollama (qwen2.5-coder:32b) |

Switch models with `/model`.

## Team Workflows

- **Shared context** — Commit `.helixmind/context.md` for same project instructions
- **Knowledge transfer** — Senior exports, new member imports
- **Code review with AI** — `helixmind chat -m "Review the changes in the last 3 commits"`

## Security

1. Run `/security` regularly (at least weekly)
2. Never commit API keys — use environment variables
3. Start with safe permissions, only escalate when needed
4. Review YOLO mode output carefully
5. Use checkpoint system — revert unwanted changes immediately
