# Web Knowledge Enricher

HelixMind **automatically searches the internet** for relevant documentation while you work — no manual searching needed.

## How It Works

| Step | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Topic Detection** | Analyzes your message for technology, pattern, or error topics |
| **2. Web Search** | Searches DuckDuckGo for relevant results |
| **3. Knowledge Extraction** | Extracts code examples, key points, and summaries from pages |
| **4. Spiral Storage** | Stored as L6 Web Knowledge nodes with quality scores + embeddings |
| **5. Brain Update** | Popup notification + particle burst in 3D Brain visualization |

## CLI Notification

```
🌐 Web Knowledge: JWT best practices for production
   Source: https://auth0.com/docs/tokens
   Quality: 0.94 │ Stored in L6 (Web Knowledge)
```

## Explicit Web Research

Besides automatic detection, you can explicitly trigger research:

```
> Search the web for Next.js 15 server actions migration guide
```

The AI uses the `web_research` tool to fetch, extract, and store findings.

## What Gets Stored

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `content` | Extracted knowledge (code, key points, summary) |
| `source` | Original URL |
| `quality` | Quality score (0.0 – 1.0) |
| `topic` | Detected topic that triggered the search |
| `embedding` | 384d vector for semantic search |

## Privacy

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Search engine | DuckDuckGo (no tracking) |
| Processing | All content processed locally |
| Storage | Only extracted knowledge stored (not raw HTML) |
| External data | Only the search query is sent externally |
| Offline | Automatically disabled with Ollama |
