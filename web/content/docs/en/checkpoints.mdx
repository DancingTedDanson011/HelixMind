# Checkpoints & Undo

HelixMind automatically creates **checkpoints** at every tool call and chat message. Revert to any previous state instantly.

## When Checkpoints Are Created

| Trigger | What's Captured |
|---------|----------------|
| Session start | Initial state |
| Chat message | Conversation snapshot |
| File read/edit/write | Before + after file content |
| Command execution | Pre-command state |
| Git commit | Pre-commit state |
| File search | Search context |
| Feed / config change | Pre-change state |

Each checkpoint stores: conversation history, file snapshots, tool call details, and timestamp.

## Storage Limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Max snapshots per session | 200 |
| Max total storage | 50MB |
| Old snapshots | Pruned automatically |

## Browsing Checkpoints

### Via Slash Command

```bash
/undo
```

Opens the interactive checkpoint browser:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Up/Down** | Navigate between checkpoints |
| **Enter** | Select checkpoint to revert |
| **ESC** | Cancel |

### Via Emergency Stop

**ESC ESC** (double-tap) → stops all operations → opens checkpoint browser.

## Revert Options

| Option | What It Reverts |
|--------|----------------|
| **Chat Only** | Conversation history (files unchanged) |
| **Code Only** | File changes (conversation unchanged) |
| **Both** | Full state rewind — conversation + all files |

## Key Points

- Even with 10 sequential edits, you can go back to any point
- Checkpoints are **per-session** — gone when you close the session
- For permanent safety, use git commits as long-term snapshots
- Don't worry about the AI breaking things — you can always revert
