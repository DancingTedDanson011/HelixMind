# Sessions & Background Tasks

HelixMind supports **multiple concurrent sessions** — run a security audit in the background while you keep coding.

## Session Types

| Type | Command | What It Does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Main** | `helixmind` | Your interactive chat — always exists |
| **Security** | `/security` | Comprehensive security scan (auto-fixes CRITICAL + HIGH) |
| **Auto** | `/auto` | Continuously scans & fixes issues by priority |
| **Custom** | `/auto <goal>` | Goal-driven: breaks goal into subtasks |

Each background session gets its own conversation history, undo stack, and agent controller.

## Security Audit Checks

| Category | What's Checked |
|----------|---------------|
| Injection | SQL injection, command injection, template injection |
| Path Traversal | Directory traversal, symlink attacks |
| XSS | Cross-site scripting, unsanitized output |
| Secrets | Hardcoded API keys, passwords, tokens |
| Dependencies | Known vulnerabilities, outdated packages |
| Validation | Missing input validation, type coercion |
| Auth | Weak authentication, missing session management |
| Race Conditions | TOCTOU bugs, concurrent access issues |

## Auto Mode Priority

1. Critical bugs and crashes
2. Security vulnerabilities
3. Missing error handling
4. Broken tests
5. Performance bottlenecks
6. Dead code
7. Code quality improvements

## Tab Bar

```
[🔒 security ●] [⚙️ auto ●] [💬 main]
```

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Ctrl+PageUp** | Previous tab |
| **Ctrl+PageDown** | Next tab |
| `/sessions` | List all sessions with status |
| `/stop` | Stop background sessions |
| **ESC ESC** | Emergency stop all |

## Session Lifecycle

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **Launch** | `/security`, `/auto`, or `/sessions` |
| **Running** | Agent works in background, you keep your prompt |
| **Notification** | Completion notification in tab bar |
| **Auto-close** | Completed sessions close after 10 seconds |
| **Results** | Findings appear in Brain's findings panel |

## Session Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `running` | Agent actively working |
| `completed` | All tasks finished |
| `error` | An error occurred |
| `aborted` | Manually stopped |
