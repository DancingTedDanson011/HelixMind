# Autonomous Modes

HelixMind can work **autonomously** in the background while you keep coding.

## Autonomous Scan (`/auto`)

```bash
/auto
```

The agent works through issues in priority order:

| Priority | Category |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | Critical bugs — crashes, null pointers, unhandled exceptions |
| 2 | Security vulnerabilities — injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets |
| 3 | Missing error handling — uncaught promises, unvalidated input |
| 4 | Broken tests — failing cases, outdated assertions |
| 5 | Performance bottlenecks — N+1 queries, unnecessary re-renders |
| 6 | Dead code — unused functions, unreachable branches |
| 7 | Code quality — linting issues, style inconsistencies |

### Goal-Driven Mode

```bash
/auto Refactor all API endpoints to use the new validation middleware
```

The agent breaks the goal into subtasks and works until completion.

## Security Audit (`/security`)

```bash
/security
```

Run a one-time security audit of your codebase:

| Category | What's Checked |
|----------|---------------|
| Injection | SQL, command, template injection |
| Path Traversal | Directory traversal, symlink attacks |
| XSS | Cross-site scripting, unsanitized output |
| Secrets | Hardcoded API keys, passwords, tokens |
| Dependencies | Known vulnerabilities, outdated packages |
| Validation | Missing input validation, type coercion |
| Auth | Weak auth, missing session management |
| Race Conditions | TOCTOU bugs, concurrent access |
| Info Disclosure | Stack traces, debug info in production |

### Auto-Fix Behavior

| Severity | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **CRITICAL** | Fixed immediately |
| **HIGH** | Fixed with notification |
| **MEDIUM** | Reported for manual review |
| **LOW** | Reported for manual review |

Findings appear in the Brain's **findings panel**.

## Continuous Security Monitor (`/monitor`)

```bash
/monitor [mode] [interval]
```

Start **continuous security monitoring** in the background:

| Mode | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| `passive` | Detects threats but takes no action (audit only) |
| `defensive` | Takes pre-approved defensive actions automatically |
| `active` | Requests approval for each defensive action via web dashboard |

**Examples:**
```
/monitor                    # Passive mode, 5 min interval
/monitor active 60         # Active mode, 60 sec interval
/monitor defensive 180     # Defensive mode, 3 min interval
```

**Features:**
- Real-time threat detection (bruteforce, portscan, malware, config changes)
- Automated defenses (block IPs, kill processes, close ports)
- Web dashboard integration (`/dashboard/monitor`)
- Approval queue for manual review (Active mode)
- Baseline system scanning and drift detection

See the [Security Monitor](/docs/security-monitor) guide for full details.

## Background Sessions

When you launch `/auto` or `/security`:

1. New session created with isolated state
2. You keep your interactive prompt
3. Background session shows as a tab
4. Notifications appear on completion
5. Sessions auto-close after 10 seconds

Each session has its own: conversation history, undo stack, agent controller.

## Controls

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/sessions` | List all sessions |
| `/stop` | Stop background sessions |
| **Ctrl+PageUp/Down** | Switch tabs |
| **ESC ESC** | Emergency stop all |

## Tips

1. Run `/security` on every new project for a baseline assessment
2. Use `/auto` for cleanup while you focus on features
3. Review findings in the Brain before committing
4. Set specific goals with `/auto` for targeted work
5. Use checkpoints — `/undo` reverts unwanted changes
