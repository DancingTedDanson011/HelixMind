# Jarvis

The **Jarvis** tab is the command center for HelixMind's autonomous AGI-style assistant. Jarvis can plan, execute, and manage complex multi-step tasks using a worker-based architecture.

## Core concepts

### Tasks

Jarvis works from a task queue. Add tasks with a title, description, and priority:

- **Critical** — Executed immediately
- **High** — Next in queue
- **Normal** — Standard priority
- **Low** — Background work

### Proposals

Before taking significant actions, Jarvis creates **proposals** for your review:

- What it wants to do
- Why it thinks this is the right approach
- Expected impact and risk level

You can **approve** or **deny** each proposal. Denied proposals include your feedback so Jarvis can adjust.

### Workers

Jarvis spawns background **workers** to handle tasks in parallel. Each worker:

- Has its own session and output stream
- Reports progress back to Jarvis
- Can be monitored in real-time

## Autonomy levels

Control how independently Jarvis operates:

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Supervised** | All actions require approval |
| **Semi-autonomous** | Low-risk actions auto-approved |
| **Autonomous** | Most actions auto-approved |
| **Full autonomy** | All actions auto-approved |

## Deep Think

Trigger a **Deep Think** session to have Jarvis analyze a complex problem thoroughly before acting. This uses extended reasoning with chain-of-thought analysis.

## Consciousness events

The Jarvis panel shows real-time consciousness events:

- Thinking phases (quick, medium, deep)
- Decision points and reasoning
- Task state transitions
- Worker lifecycle events

These events also appear as animated neurons in the Brain visualization.

## Starting Jarvis

Use the Jarvis tab controls or the CLI:

```bash
/jarvis start
/jarvis add "Refactor the auth module" --priority high
/jarvis pause
/jarvis resume
```

## Session output

When Jarvis is running, the terminal output stream appears below the task panel, showing real-time agent activity and tool calls.
