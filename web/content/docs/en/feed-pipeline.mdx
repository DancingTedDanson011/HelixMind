# Feed Pipeline

The feed pipeline imports **files in bulk** into the spiral memory.

## Usage

```bash
helixmind feed README.md src/architecture.md   # Specific files
helixmind feed src/                             # Directory (recursive)
/feed                                           # Interactive in chat
```

## Feed Modes

| Mode | Flag | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Quick** (default) | — | Fast overview, key patterns |
| **Deep** | `--deep` | Thorough analysis of every file |
| **Watch** | `--watch` | Continuous monitoring on file changes |

## What Gets Extracted

| File Type | Extraction |
|-----------|-----------|
| `.ts`, `.js` | Functions, classes, exports, imports |
| `.json` | Config structure, keys |
| `.md` | Sections, concepts |
| Config files | Framework settings |

Automatically ignored: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.git/`, binaries, lock files.

## Memory Impact

Fed content starts at **L2 Active**. Over time: frequently used knowledge promotes to L1, unused decays to L3–L5. Web-fetched knowledge enters separately at L6.

## Tips

1. **Feed early** — `helixmind feed README.md` right after `helixmind init`
2. **Deep-feed core code** — `--deep` for your most important directories
3. **Don't over-feed** — Quality over quantity
4. **Re-feed after major changes** — After refactoring, re-feed the changed directories
