# Authentication

HelixMind uses a browser-based login flow to connect your CLI to your web platform account. After a one-time login, credentials are cached locally and the CLI works offline.

## Login

```bash
# Browser-based login (recommended)
helixmind login

# Direct API key login
helixmind login --api-key hm_your_key_here

# Custom platform URL
helixmind login --url https://your-instance.example.com

# Re-authenticate (even if already logged in)
helixmind login --force
```

### How the Browser Flow Works

1. The CLI starts a temporary local server on `127.0.0.1`
2. Your default browser opens the HelixMind authorization page
3. You log in (or authorize immediately if already signed in)
4. The webapp redirects back to the CLI with an API key
5. The CLI stores the key locally at `~/.helixmind/config.json`

The flow uses a cryptographic `state` parameter for CSRF protection. The local callback server accepts exactly one response and times out after 120 seconds.

If the browser cannot be opened automatically, the CLI prints the URL for you to open manually.

## Logout

```bash
# Logout and revoke the API key on the server
helixmind logout

# Logout locally only (keep server key valid)
helixmind logout --no-revoke
```

## Check Status

```bash
helixmind whoami
```

Shows your email, subscription plan, and masked API key. Works offline with cached data.

## Slash Commands

During an interactive chat session, you can also use:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/login` | Start login flow |
| `/logout` | Log out and revoke key |
| `/whoami` | Show account info |

## Auth Guard

Most CLI commands require authentication. If you run a command without being logged in, HelixMind will automatically start the login flow. Commands that **do not** require auth:

- `helixmind login`
- `helixmind logout`
- `helixmind whoami`
- `helixmind config`
- `helixmind --help` / `helixmind --version`

After first login, the CLI uses your cached credentials and verifies them in the background when online.

## API Keys

API keys are prefixed with `hm_` and stored hashed (SHA-256) on the server. Each key has scopes (`cli`, `relay`) and a device name.

Key limits by plan:

| Plan | Max API Keys |
|------|-------------|
| Free | 3 |
| Pro | 10 |
| Team | 25 |
| Enterprise | Unlimited |

You can manage API keys from your web dashboard at **Dashboard > API Keys**.

## Config Keys

Authentication stores the following keys in `~/.helixmind/config.json`:

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `relay.apiKey` | Your HelixMind API key |
| `relay.url` | Web platform URL |
| `relay.userId` | Your user ID |
| `relay.userEmail` | Your email address |
| `relay.plan` | Your subscription plan |
| `relay.loginAt` | Timestamp of last login |
| `relay.autoConnect` | Auto-connect to relay on startup |
