# Security Monitor & Audits

> **Requires Login (Free+):** The Security Monitor and `/security` audit require a free HelixMind account. Run `helixmind login` to unlock — it's free, no credit card needed.

HelixMind includes a **real-time security monitoring system** that runs in the background while you code, detecting threats, performing security audits, and optionally taking automated defensive actions.

## Overview

The Security Monitor works in three modes:

| Mode | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| **Passive** | Detects threats but takes no action (audit only) |
| **Defensive** | Takes pre-approved defensive actions automatically |
| **Active** | Requests approval for each defensive action via web dashboard |

## How It Works

1. **Baseline Scan** — Creates a snapshot of your system (processes, ports, configs, packages, users, cron jobs)
2. **Continuous Monitoring** — Periodically rescans and compares against baseline
3. **Threat Detection** — Identifies anomalies, suspicious processes, open ports, config changes
4. **Defense Actions** — Can block IPs, kill processes, close ports, rotate secrets, isolate services
5. **Approval Flow** — Requests approval via web dashboard (in Active mode)

## Starting the Monitor

### CLI Command

```
/monitor [mode] [interval]
```

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|:----------|:------------|:--------|
| `mode` | `passive`, `defensive`, or `active` | `passive` |
| `interval` | Rescan interval in seconds | `300` (5 minutes) |

Examples:
```
/monitor                    # Start in passive mode (5 min interval)
/monitor active 60          # Start in active mode, rescan every 60 seconds
/monitor defensive 180      # Start in defensive mode, 3 min interval
```

### Security Audit (One-time)

```
/security [scope]
```

Run a one-time security audit:

```
/security                   # Full system audit
/security ports             # Check open ports only
/security processes         # Check running processes
/security configs           # Check config file changes
/security packages          # Check for vulnerable packages
```

## Web Dashboard Integration

Connect to the web dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/monitor` to:

- **View real-time threats** on threat timeline
- **See active defenses** with undo capability
- **Approve/deny actions** in approval queue
- **Change monitor mode** (passive/defensive/active)
- **View system baseline** and drift detection

## Threat Categories

The monitor detects:

| Category | What It Detects |
|:---------|:----------------|
| **Bruteforce** | Multiple failed login attempts |
| **Portscan** | Unusual port scanning patterns |
| **Exfiltration** | Large outbound data transfers |
| **Malware** | Suspicious processes, known malware signatures |
| **Config Change** | Unauthorized configuration file changes |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Unexpected privilege changes |
| **Secret Leak** | Potential secret exposure in files |
| **Anomaly** | Statistical anomalies in system behavior |

## Defense Actions

When a threat is detected, the monitor can:

| Action | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| **Block IP** | Block suspicious IP via firewall |
| **Kill Process** | Terminate malicious process |
| **Close Port** | Close unexpected open port |
| **Rotate Secret** | Automatically rotate exposed secret |
| **Isolate Service** | Network-isolate compromised service |
| **Deploy Honeypot** | Deploy decoy service to track attacker |

## Configuration

Enable/configure monitoring in `.helixmind/config.json`:

```json
{
  "monitor": {
    "enabled": true,
    "defaultMode": "passive",
    "scanInterval": 300,
    "maxThreatHistory": 1000,
    "autoApproveLow": false,
    "allowedDefenses": ["block_ip", "kill_process", "close_port"]
  }
}
```

## Permissions

Monitor operations require explicit permissions:

| Operation | Permission Level |
|:----------|:----------------|
| **Passive scanning** | `auto` (always allowed) |
| **Defensive actions** | `ask` (requires approval in Active mode) |
| **Active monitoring** | `ask` (requires approval to start) |

Use `/permissions` to view and adjust permission settings.
