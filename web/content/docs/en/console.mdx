# Console

The **Console** tab in the HelixMind web app gives you direct control over autonomous CLI sessions. It streams real-time output from background tasks running on your connected CLI instance.

## What runs in Console?

Console displays output from sessions started via `/auto` and `/security`:

- **Auto Mode** — Give the agent a goal and let it work autonomously. It reads, writes, and tests code without waiting for your input.
- **Security Audit** — Scans your project for vulnerabilities, insecure patterns, and OWASP issues. Findings appear in the Brain visualization.
- **Custom Sessions** — Any background session spawned from the CLI appears here.

## Starting a session

Click the **Start** buttons in the Console tab, or use the CLI directly:

```bash
/auto fix all TypeScript errors
/security
```

The web app auto-connects to running sessions and streams their output in real-time.

## Session output

The terminal viewer shows a live feed of the agent's actions:

- Tool calls (file reads, writes, commands)
- Agent reasoning and decisions
- Errors and warnings
- Progress indicators

## Multiple sessions

You can run multiple background sessions simultaneously. Use the session sidebar to switch between them. Each session has its own output buffer and undo stack.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `ESC ESC` | Emergency stop — aborts all sessions |
| `Ctrl+PageUp/Down` | Switch session tabs (CLI) |

## Tips

- Start a security audit before pushing code — findings are saved to the Brain
- Auto mode respects the permission system — use `--yolo` in CLI for fully autonomous work
- Session output is buffered — you can switch tabs and come back without losing output
