# Brain Visualization

HelixMind includes a **real-time 3D brain visualization** that renders your spiral memory as an interactive helix in your browser.

## Quick Start

```bash
/brain          # Open in default browser
/brain local    # Project-local scope only
/brain global   # All projects, cross-project view
```

Opens at `http://127.0.0.1:9420` (auto-selects another port if busy).

## The Helix

Nodes are arranged in a **3D double-helix** pattern:

| Visual | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Node size** | Scales with relevance — important nodes are larger |
| **Cyan nodes** | L1 Focus |
| **Green nodes** | L2 Active |
| **Blue nodes** | L3 Reference |
| **Violet nodes** | L4 Archive |
| **Gray nodes** | L5 Deep Archive |
| **Orange nodes** | L6 Web Knowledge |
| **Glowing lines** | Edges connecting related nodes |

## Live Updates

When the AI is working, the brain updates in real-time:

| Event | Visual |
|-------|--------|
| New node created | Particle burst animation |
| Web knowledge found | Popup notification with topic + source |
| Edge connection formed | Glowing line appears |
| Level change | Node shifts position in helix |

## Findings Panel

When `/security` or `/auto` are running, a **left sidebar** shows:

- Discovered issues + severity
- Files analyzed
- Fixes applied
- Agent progress

## Interaction

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Rotate** | Click + drag |
| **Zoom** | Scroll wheel |
| **Hover** | Mouse over node → content preview |
| **Auto-rotate** | Enabled by default |

## Open Source vs Login

The basic 3D brain visualization (`/brain`) works in **both Open Source and logged-in mode**. However, advanced Brain Management features (multiple brains, renaming, Global/Local tabs) require a free login.

| Feature | Open Source | Free+ (Login) |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 3D Brain Visualization | Yes | Yes |
| Live Updates | Yes | Yes |
| Findings Panel | — | Yes |
| Multiple Brains | — | Yes |
| Brain Renaming | — | Yes |
| Global Brain | — | Yes |

## Technical

- **Renderer**: Three.js + WebGL + Bloom post-processing
- **Transport**: WebSocket for real-time push updates
- **Performance**: Instanced rendering for hundreds of nodes
- **Background**: Star field particle system for depth
